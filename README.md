# Boilerplate

This boilerplate uses Bower to install and manage dependancies such as RequireJS, etc.
Boilerplate comes with a bower.json that will install all of the dependancies for you. Follow the commands below on your terminal to do this. 

```shell
$ npm install -g bower
$ bower install
```
Or you can install dependancies individually

```shell
$ bower install <package>
```

### Bower Components/Dependancies

1. HTML5 Boilerplate

 - Use on its own to stablish a starting point in your web dev workflow. Use other components as needed.

2. Normalize.css

 - A way to start styles fresh without using brower defaults and to help them be cross-brower

3. RequireJS

 - Work on your Javascript with modules and load a single file inside your index.html while using the require.js file to help pull all your modules at once. You can then optimize (minify/concatenante) your files into a single one with r.js, a optimization tool for RequireJS.
