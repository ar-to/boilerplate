# Boilerplate

This boilerplate uses Bower to install and manage dependancies such as RequireJS, etc.
Boilerplate comes with a bower.json that will install all of the dependancies for you. Follow the commands below on your terminal to do this. 

```shell
$ npm install -g bower
$ bower install
```
Or you can install dependancies individually

   $ bower install <package>
